Duuuude, just finished watching Borderline, and man, let me tell you, my brain's in a hundred places right now. This film was like a rollercoaster through a really wobbly dimension, you know what I mean? Itâ€™s like they threw sanity out the window and decided, Okay, let's make everyone question their life choices. ðŸ˜‚

First off, that main character? Wow. I just wanna reach through the screen and shake them half the time. But also, can relateâ€”been there, done that. Itâ€™s like watching your own messy thoughts unravel, but in a more dramatic and kinda absurd way. Seriously, who thinks up this stuff? And can we talk about the dialogue? ðŸ¤¯ One minute Iâ€™m cackling like a maniac, next Iâ€™m like, What even is reality anymore?

> Also, the soundtrack?? It slaps. So unexpected but perfect. Like, I was vibing way too hard during some scenes where you probably shouldnâ€™t be vibing at all. Why does that always happen in these artsy films?

So, this one sceneâ€”no spoilers, promiseâ€”had me questioning if I accidentally downloaded the movie while mid-dream. It's like, there's this blend of what's real and what's someone's bizarre daydream, and suddenly nothing makes sense, but it kinda does, you know? Ugh, it's hard to explain without giving it away. Just gotta watch the movie to grasp the chaos.

And uuugh, towards the end, my brain's just like, Do I get this? Do I even want to get this? I'm invested, but confused, but also a bit tired of thinking at this point. ðŸ¤ª I thought I had it all figured out, then BAMâ€”not even close. Such a trip. But hey, worth the watch, gotta say. Even if my brain feels fried.

Anyway, might need to lie down or something. Letâ€™s catch up later, yeah? Lemme know if you watch itâ€” might need a support group after that wild ride.
